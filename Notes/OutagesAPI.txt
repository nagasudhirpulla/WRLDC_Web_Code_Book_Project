Aim - Find the requesting entities automatically and place them in the requesting list in the UI
************************************************************************************************

For Line - Find the line owner from "elements" table. find the substations associated with line and find that substation ids from "elements_substations" table. Now find the owners of substations and the owner ids from the "substations" table

For Generator - Find the generator id from the "generator_units" or "generator_units_new" table and using that generator id, find the generator owner id from the "generators" table and add to requesting entities list

For ICT - Find the owner id from "???" table, find the substation of element from "???" table and find the owner of that substation from "substations" table and add it to the requesting entities list

For other element types - Find the owner id from "???" table, find the substation of element from "???" table and find the owner of that substation from "substations" table and add it to the requesting entities list

Aim - Add outages to the outage database through post request
